use proper exception class
-use static class functions if possible (avoid instantiation)

-remove whitespaces after doing getline


-make sure '-' can be used as a unary operator ('-1')
-make sure any number of minuses can be stacked (---1 == -1, 5--1 == 6)
-make sure any number of pluses can be stacked as well.

future features:
-support for floats (not just integers)
-throw an exception class that has the problematic line, the position, and the index (see how the python ui throws errors)
