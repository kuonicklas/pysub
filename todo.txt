TODO:
-align the columns of show(tokens) output

-remember to remove whitespaces for the output of getline

-make sure '-' can be used as a unary operator ('-1')
-make sure any number of minuses can be stacked (---1 == -1, 5--1 == 6)
-make sure any number of pluses can be stacked as well.

future features:
-support for floats (not just integers)
-throw an exception class that has the problematic line, the position, and the index (see how the python ui throws errors)

notes:
-max int representation is not [int min, int max], but (int min, int max]. This is because the negative sign and the digits are treated separately in intermediate stages, and the absolute value must be storable into a normal int.
