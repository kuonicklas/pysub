TODO:
-show(variables) argument for show()

-remember to remove whitespaces for the output of getline

-make sure '-' can be used as a unary operator ('-1')
-make sure any number of minuses can be stacked (---1 == -1, 5--1 == 6)
-make sure any number of pluses can be stacked as well.

future features:
-support for floats (not just integers)
-throw an exception class that has the problematic line, the position, and the index (see how the python ui throws errors)

notes:
-max int representation is not [int min, int max], but (int min, int max]. This is because the negative sign and the digits are treated separately in intermediate stages, and the absolute value must be storable into a normal int.

reset symbol table when switching between inlin

ideally, expevaluator returns the symbol table

Execution -> file, tokens, symbol table


Execution from_interface
Execution from_file



-only one execution at a time.
-if we run inline, and the current execution is not inline

Execution current_execution; -> symbol table, file_lines, file_tokens

Execution is std::variant<InterfaceExecution, FileExecution>

// when we run inline (and curr_execution.type == File), we clear data, i.e. replace with a new object
// when we run a file and curr_execution.type == Interface, we delete also clear data.
--for interface, we gather the lines, get tokens, and do curr_execution.RunCode(tokens)
--for a file, we call 'read', which creates a new execution and stores the lines and tokens (curr_execution.SetFile(lines), and call curr_execution.RunFile(), which is a wrapper for RunCode(file_tokens)
---maybe "Read" should be in the execution (so curr_execution.ReadFile, curr_execution.GetFileLines, curr_execution.GetTokens, curr_execution.Run)

maybe we *do* use inheritance. so Execution -> FileExecution and InterfaceExecution. Execution has a symbol table and RunCode(tokens). The children do private inheritance, so that RunCode(tokens) cannot be called from the user. InterfaceExecution has RunLines(tokens), which just calls RunCode(tokens). FileExecution only has RunFile().
